# There are two infographics that I have included. One is very brief while the other is a little more detailed. 
# There is a ipynb file that includes the code for all our visualizations and another ipynb that has the code for an extra visualization that we did for third part, an interactive world map with color coding and displays a tooltip when you hover over any country.
